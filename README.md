Problem Statement:

The job market is dynamic and ever-evolving, with job seekers and employers alike needing access to accurate and up-to-date information on job openings. In this context, our portal aims to provide a seamless and efficient platform for job seekers to explore opportunities and for employers to connect with potential candidates. In light of the prevailing economic trends and the ongoing recession, the job market has become more competitive than ever. Job seekers are grappling with the challenge of identifying suitable employment opportunities that align with their skills and interests.

 In response to this pressing need, our objective is to create an integrated solution that caters to the essential requirements of job seekers, ultimately assisting them in securing their ideal job positions. To achieve this, the portal needs a robust information integration system that ensures real-time updates of job listings from various sources. 
 
A lack of centralized information sources and a proliferation of job platforms across the internet have made the job search process time-consuming and overwhelming. In order to alleviate this issue, we are focused on developing a holistic platform that streamlines job search activities, offers diverse job openings across various domains, and leverages skill matching to ensure a harmonious job seeker-employment fit.
